# HEAGB
Data based analytical model (DBAM) and machine learning for HEA GBs

This repository contains the data and code for our recent work:

C. Hu and J. Luo, Decoding the Grain Boundary Thermodynamics in High-Entropy Alloys: A Data-Based Analytical Model beyond Machine Learning, https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12865

The current repository demonstrates the use of DBAM and ANN models for predicting GB properties for CrMnFeCoNi HEAs.
